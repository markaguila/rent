# This is an exploratory data analysis of US apartment rent from Jamuary 2017 to September 2020.
# It includes rent from different sized apartments in hundreds of US cities and most US states. 
# I will look to answer different questions such as:
#
# - How has rent changed over time?
# - How does rent vary by state? 
# - How does the price of living alone compare to living with roommates?
#
# Data taken from Apartment List (https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/category/data-rent-estimates)
# Note - Code is interactive if ran as a Jupyter Notebook
